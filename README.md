# WATmerch - Android App (work in progress)
## Description
Android application for viewing, ordering and managing the store's products of WAT merchandise. The application has the ability to register and log in. It is based on communication with an external API created by my colleague (https://github.com/qsspy/WATmerch-backend), which uses Java Spring Boot and MySQL database.
